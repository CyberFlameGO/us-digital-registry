## Overview

To help prevent exploitation from unofficial sources, phishing scams, or malicious entities, the U.S. Digital Registry serves as a crowdsource resource for agencies, citizens, and developers to confirm the official status of social media and public-facing collaboration accounts, mobile apps, and mobile websites. The accounts in the registry are independently updated by federal managers across the government who maintain individual agency accounts.
